# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by:Popuri Siva Naga Nithin 
#RegisterNumber:21003942
base = int(input())
power= int(input())
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",base**power)

*/
```

## Output:
